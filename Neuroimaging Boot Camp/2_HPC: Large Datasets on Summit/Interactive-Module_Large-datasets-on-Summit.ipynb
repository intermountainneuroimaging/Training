    "With the push for open science, the availiblity of public neuroimaging datasets has drastically advanced in recent years, with many more datasets being shared each year. Scientific governing bodies such as the NIH, NSF, and others have put high priority on open science data for several reasons:\n",
    "1. Increase reporducibility of published work\n",
    "2. Increase exploration of new analytic techniques on existing data\n",
    "3. Expand research knowledge gained from any federally funded research\n",
